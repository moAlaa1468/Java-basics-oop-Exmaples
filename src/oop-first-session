 Introduction to Objects, Attributes, and Operations in Java | Java Programming Tutorial

Description:

Welcome to our Java programming tutorial! In this video,

 we'll introduce you to the basics of objects, attributes, and operations in Java.
This tutorial is perfect for beginners who are just starting with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

What You’ll Learn:
Understanding objects in Java.
Defining attributes (fields) of an object.
Implementing operations (methods) of an object.
Simple examples to demonstrate these concepts.
Examples:
Defining a Class and Creating Objects:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects have attributes (fields) and operations (methods).

java
Copy code
// Defining a class
public class Car {
    // Attributes (fields)
    String brand;
    String color;
    int year;

    // Operation (method)
    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand);
        System.out.println("Color: " + color);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object
        Car myCar = new Car();

        // Setting attributes
        myCar.brand = "Toyota";
        myCar.color = "Red";
        myCar.year = 2020;

        // Calling a method (operation)
        myCar.displayInfo(); // Outputs: Brand: Toyota, Color: Red, Year: 2020
    }
}
Another Example with a Different Object:
Let's create a Student class with attributes and operations.

java
Copy code
// Defining a class
public class Student {
    // Attributes (fields)
    String name;
    int age;
    String grade;

    // Operation (method)
    void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object
        Student student1 = new Student();

        // Setting attributes
        student1.name = "Alice";
        student1.age = 20;
        student1.grade = "A";

        // Calling a method (operation)
        student1.displayDetails(); // Outputs: Name: Alice, Age: 20, Grade: A
    }
}

Description of the Class and Operations:
Attributes (Fields):

name: The student's name.
universityId: The student's university ID.
birthDate: The student's birth date.
address: The student's address.
gpa: The student's Grade Point Average.
studyLevel: The student's level of study (e.g., Undergraduate, Graduate).




Constructor:

The constructor initializes all the attributes of the Student object.




Operations (Methods):

modifyGpa(double newGpa): Updates the student's GPA.
changeStudyLevel(String newStudyLevel): Changes the student's level of study.
getStudentName(): Returns the student's name.
getStudentAddress(): Returns the student's address.
displayStudentDetails(): Displays all the details of the student.



Usage:
The main method demonstrates creating a Student object, displaying its details, modifying the GPA and study level,
and then displaying the updated details. It also demonstrates retrieving and printing the student's name and address.
This class structure encapsulates
the student's information and provides methods to interact with and modify that information,
 demonstrating core principles of Object-Oriented Programming in Java.

Attributes (Fields):

length: The length of the rectangle.
width: The width of the rectangle.

Methods:

calculateArea(): Calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
calculatePerimeter(): Calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle.

Main Method Testing :

Tests the Rectangle class by creating a Rectangle object,
displaying its attributes, calculating and displaying its area and perimeter,
modifying its dimensions,
and then recalculating and displaying the new area and perimeter.

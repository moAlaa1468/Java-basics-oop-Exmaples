Repetition statements
------------------- While  Loops -------------
Sometimes we need to repeat a specific actions number of times until
a particular condition is being satisfied

example :
 PROBLEM:
 what will you use if you want to calculate the average of 10 students
 Will you repeat the code for each student OR you will use loops


What are the types of while Loops
		-While loop
		-do while loop
		-for loop

---------------------------------------------
==> While Loop


=====parts of while loop====
-initial value
-condition
-some codes
-counter or update statement

Here is an example that uses a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 5:

	int i = 0;         //initial value
        while (i <= 5) { // condition
            System.out.println("Number: " + i);   //some codes
            i++;        // update statement
        }

Explanation of the Example:
Initialization: The variable i is initialized to 1.
Condition: The while loop checks if i is less than or equal to 5.
Loop Body: If the condition is true, it prints the value of i and then increments i by 1.
Update Statement: The variable i is incremented to ensure that the condition will eventually become false, stopping the loop.
Termination: When i becomes greater than 5, the condition i <= 5 evaluates to false, and the loop terminates.


Shapes of condition :
	- while (i<=10)
	- while  (i>=10 && j<=15)
	- while (3+6)

--------------------------------------------- Examples or Some Tasks ---------------
-Task 1
 Write the program that calculate the average grade of 6 students .
Don't forget the counter or you will be in the infinity Loop
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 2 :
-- Write the program that calculate the average grade of 6 students or  enter -1 to Exit the Loop .
--- you will use && grade != -1
Don't forget the counter or you will be in the infinity Loop
        int grade=0,sum=0;
        int counter=1;
    while(counter<=4 && grade != -1){
        System.out.println("enter you grade or enter -1 if you want to exit ");
        grade=scanner.nextInt();
        if(grade == -1)
        {
            System.out.println("first must not be 0");
            counter = 2;
            break;
        }
        if(grade != -1 ){
            sum+=grade;
            counter++;
        }
    }
        System.out.println("the counter is :"+ (counter-1));
        System.out.println("The average of all grades is :" + sum / (counter -1));
---------------------------------------------------------------------------






Task 3:
---- Write a program that asks the user to enter positive
    numbers at the keyboard which are added together.
	to stop the addition the user enters a negative number.
	===> answer use the flag variable










    int number=0,sum=0;
    boolean flag=true;
    while(flag){
        System.out.println(" Enter Your number if you want to continue or enter -1 if you want to exit");
        number=scanner.nextInt();
       if(number!=-1){
           sum+=number;
       }else{
           flag=false;
       }
    }
    System.out.println("Your summation is : "+ sum);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 4:

This program simulates a simple system for tracking points earned by students in school for completing assignments.
 It uses a while loop to interactively allow students to earn points and track their progress.



      Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("enter yes or no ");
        int totalPoints = 0; // Initial total points
        int pointsPerAssignment = 5; // Points earned per assignment

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Student Points Tracking System!");

        while (true) {
            System.out.println("Your current total points: " + totalPoints);
            System.out.println("Do you want to complete an assignment? (yes/no): ");
            String response = scanner.nextLine();

            if (response.equalsIgnoreCase("no")) {
                break; // Exit the loop if the student does not want to complete more assignments
            }

            // Complete an assignment
            System.out.println("Congratulations! You completed an assignment and earned " + pointsPerAssignment + " points.");
            totalPoints += pointsPerAssignment;

            System.out.println("----------------------");
        }

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 5 :
use the flag variable:
Write a program that prompts the user to guess a number between 0 and 100 ; then displays an appropriate message
with each guess. The guess is to be compared with a generated random number.
 The program also outputs the number of trails at the end.
     Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    int guess ;
    int scaledNumber;
    boolean flag = true;
    //we need make the computer generate a random number
      int  randomNumber=(int)(Math.random()*100);
        scaledNumber=(int)randomNumber;
        System.out.println(scaledNumber);
    while(flag){
        System.out.println("enter a Number to play with us");
        guess=scanner.nextInt();
        if(guess<scaledNumber){
            System.out.println("your number is too small");
        }else if(guess>scaledNumber){
            System.out.println("your number is too large");
        }else{
            System.out.println("you win ");
            flag=false;
        }
    }

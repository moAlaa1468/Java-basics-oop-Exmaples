============ Functions of Methods in Java =========
What are Functions (Methods)?

In Java, a function (referred to as a method) is a block of code that performs a specific task.
Methods are used to organize and structure your code, making it more readable, reusable, and maintainable.

Why Use Methods
Code Reusability:
Methods allow you to write a piece of code once and reuse
it multiple times throughout your program.
This reduces redundancy and helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
In real life problems include hundreds and even thousands of
lines === so you will need to use methods or functions


===> you will divide your code to small parts
function is a self-contained block
 	of statements that perform a specific task;
----------------------------------------------
Using a function is something like a person to do a specific job for you.

function maximum is 15 lines of code. [small units]

public ==> could be called from this class or outside this class
static ==> to call the function inside a specific class without taking object from this class


Syntax for typing function:

accessModifier returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // Method body
    // Code to be executed

}


1-
	returned-value-type fucntionName(parameters-list){
	block of code
	}
2-Invoking[calling] function(from the main())
	functionName(actual parameter-list)
-----------------------------------------------------
What are the types of functions:
	Built in functions(ready Made)
	abs() | pow() | floor() | sqrt()
	ex: Math.random();

Task 1:
calculate and print out the sum and the average of 3 students marks.



--------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 2:
	Write a function that draws line To use it as separator between your codes.
	.Hint You need to give the function the number of stars used for creating the line and the charSHape



---------------------------------------------------------------
Task 3:
	Make any function That takes any inputs and return any outputs ex: sum function
	 ... you have to return a value.If use this function in another expression
Task 4:
	create a function [average] that uses another function (sum) To print the average of Four Numbers
	and create separator function to display the output of the average and the sum of these four Numbers:







-----------------------------------------------------------------
Task 5:
	Bring the factorial of any number that user enters .. only user methods


	    int fact=1;
            for (int i = 1; i <=6; i++){
                fact=fact*i;

            }

public class RecursiveMethod {
    // Recursive method to calculate factorial
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1; // Base case
        } else {
            return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive call
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Method call
        int result = factorial(5);
        System.out.println("Factorial of 5 is: " + result);
    }
}
